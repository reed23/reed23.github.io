                               <strong> DESCRIBE THE COMPANY/SERVICE THAT THE COMPANY PROVIDES:</strong>
                                ￼CFF provides services, resources and educational events to help build families and communities by empowering fathers and showing them how to be leaders and mentors for their kids.</p>
                                <p>

                                <br><strong>
                                WHAT ARE THE COMPANY’S PRIMARY GOALS/OBJECTIVES FOR THE SITE? </strong> <br>
                                CFF wants to promote their programs to fathers in need. We want to provide resources and educational materials for fathers that might be struggling with how to handle their kids and the difficulties of fatherhood. We want to help fathers rebuild their lives and reconnect with their loved ones. We want to teach them how to provide for their families and how to create a loving environment for their children.
                                We also want to encourage users to contribute to the nonprofit. The cost of putting one father through the program is about $2k, so they need donors. We really need to collect more donations through the site.</p>
                                <p> <strong><br>
                                WHO IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR THE SITE? WHAT INFORMATION/CONTENT IS THE AUDIENCE LOOKING FOR?</strong>
                                CFF serves around 1200 fathers annually with programs designed to teach fathers the skills necessary to be providers, partners, and community leaders. Programs like A Father’s Place and Man 2 Man are helping hundreds of fathers find their place in the world. Fathers who visit the site are looking for help for a host of problems. Some of them are recovering from their past mistakes and want to rebuild their families. Some are having difficulty being providers. Some fathers just need someone to talk to about their problems.
                                The site should provide information about the programs and how to become a participant. Our mission should be clear and express the values of our faith-based organization.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>
                                DESCRIBE THE COMPANY’S BRAND, PERSONALITY, AND CULTURE </strong>
                                We are a faith-based organization based in Columbia that seeks to help fathers find their way in the world. We are welcoming and open to people who may have not made the best decisions in their past. We want troubled fathers to feel at home and that we can be trusted to help them rebuild their lives.
                                We believe that Christ is the way to a better life, but we understand that others may not share exactly our faith. We want to help even the most wayward souls find happiness.
                                Low income dads have common challenges, and many of them are unable to pay child support because they lack an education, job or transportation. For some the challenges are growing. With unemployment rates at 9.6 percent, many low-income fathers remain unemployed and unable to pay child support. Failure to pay child support often results in incarceration for non- custodial parents; however, statistics indicate that 43 percent of fathers jailed solely for non- payment of child support will return to jail once released creating a costly cycle. The inmate
                                population continues to exceed capacities in county detention centers. About 10,000 inmates are released annually and close to 40 percent of them will be re-incarcerated within 36 months.
                                We feel that this vicious cycle can be halted with the right leadership and help. We want to be there for these fathers and their families.
                                WHAT ASPECTS OF THE COMPANIES CURRENT SITE WORK WELL?
                                The site is easy to read and looks very nice on a phone. We like that. We also like whats in the navigation. Providing links directly to all of our services has been really helpful.
                                Also, the colors are very nice, though we have been thinking that the red should be replaced with something less threatening. What do you think?
                                We love the homepage and have gotten many compliments on it, but no one seems to click on the news links.
                                WHAT ASPECTS OF THE COMPANIES CURRENT SITE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL?
                                1. The subpages are kind of ‘busy’. They are a little confusing because so much is going on. Fathers are having a hard time finding resources. Maybe the design could be simplified a little so that its easier to find stuff?
                                2. No one ever watches the testimony videos.
                                3. Sometimes fathers confuse the two search bars. The ‘find a program’ bar and the ‘google search bar’ look a lot alike but they do different things. We need the search bar because fathers use it all the time, but maybe you could do something so that they aren’t confused.
                                4. Online donations have decreased since the site was launched last year. I don’t know why, but maybe the donate button is hard to find. Donations are up and down all year, but maybe there’s something that you can do.
