                  <h1>What is Grok</h1>
                    <p> GROK is an event unlike any other. It’s a gathering of creative people who want to connect with their peers and discuss the most pressing issues of our day. It’s a call for everyone who is tired of events where passive attendees sit for hours at a time and listen to speakers on stage. GROK is an event for active learning and sharing and where every voice truly matters.
                  Instead of listening to speakers, GROK is built around group discussions called 10/20

                                10/20s are mediated discussions between about a dozen participants. Any participant in a 10/20 can propose a topic for discussion. You can talk about software, your work environment, your personal challenges–anything that’s on your mind.

                                After 10 minutes of conversation, the session leader can choose to close the topic and ask for another. If the conversation is particularly interesting, the session leader can extend the clock for another 10 minutes, hence the name, “10/20s.”</p>

                 <h1>Why is grok so great</h1>
                    <p> When anyone asks me why past LessConfs are “successful” I tell them, an attendee will leave an event happy if the following is met.

                    New Relationships: Attendees need to meet and consider 2+ people as new friends.
                    Past Relationships: If this is your second event, bring together old friends and past attendees.
                    Speakers: Attendees should remember 3-5 inspirational moments or quotes.
                    Free time: Attendees should have enough down time to have a deep conversation with a few fellow attendees.
                    Most conference organizers haven’t figured out how to encourage relationships among attendees. Event organizers cram as many tutorial-based talks as they can into the allotted time. Attendees end up struggling to meet speakers. Parties are loud, crowded and attempt to feel “cool” instead of helping attendees interact and mingle.
